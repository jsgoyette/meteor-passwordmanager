A secure message has been created for you. It can be retrieved at the address below:

{{ urlFor 'secure-retrieve' _id=output._id hash=output.key }}

Please note, the message is deleted once it's retrieved and cannot be viewed again. Be careful not to reload the page before you are done viewing.

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>By submitting your message in the above form, you are provided a URL that someone can use to retrieve the message, though only one time.</li>
    <li>Once your friend retrieves the encrypted message, it is deleted out of the database entirely. No metadata about the message is stored, such as timestamps or IP addresses.</li>
    <li>Upon submitting the above form a passphrase (with more than 80 bits of entropy) is generated on the client, and then the message is encrypted with AES-256.</li>
    <li>Only the encrypted message is sent to the server. The passphrase is simply displayed within the generated text and is never sent over the wire.</li>
  </ul>
